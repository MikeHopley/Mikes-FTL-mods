# Mike's FTL mods

These are the mods I use with FTL. I made some of them, but not others.

I prefer vanilla gameplay, without any balance changes. Unless stated otherwise, none of these mods change the gameplay.

You will need [Slipstream Mod Manager](http://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=17102) to install mods. None of these mods require the Hyperspace modding API.

## Quality of life

* [Enhanced fleet pursuit](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=38228): shows future fleet progress, including when it's delayed
* [Better info + smaller tooltips](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=38336): shows more detailed info, and optionally smaller tooltips
* [Better crew defaults](http://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=36285&p=125013): better initial crew placement (some still need moving)

Cheatengine is not a mod, it's an external program. It can be used to speed up the game or assign skills instantly:

* [Cheatengine](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/621w0b/training_speedhack_instructions_external_software/)
* [Cheatengine table for FTL crew skills](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/qbzev0/convenient_crew_training_cheat_engine_table/)


## Graphics and music

If you install both of the first two mods here, make sure to load Pretty Shields **after** Graphical Fixes.

* [Mike’s graphical fixes](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=35599): various fixes of small graphical errors
* [Pretty shields](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=32736): gives a 3D effect to both player and enemy shields, and improves positioning
* [Mike’s background mod](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=36291): much more visually lush backgrounds
* [Mike’s music mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/agl0gx/music_mod/): incorporates Ben Prunty's unofficial extended FTL album, plus one more track
* [Beam colour changes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x0apzk1874gyyy4/Beam%20colour%20tweaks%20v1.0.ftl?dl=0): small changes to give individual beams a touch more character
* [Swarm missile sound](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=36287): just gives a distinct "whoosh" sound for the weapon
* [Hide banner ad](http://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=32910): removes the Into the Breach advert from the game menu

## Silly stuff

* [Nope mod](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lhw8fu4xry1nc8b/NOPE.ftl): just replaces “Resist” with “Nope”
* [Distraction Boys](https://www.dropbox.com/s/szmfnoplxytg1cd/Distraction%20boys.ftl?dl=0): when only the Boys can keep you satisfied. Just changes the augment text

## Challenge mods

These **do change gameplay**. They are only for doing specific challenge runs.

* [Broken shields](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/bq26to/broken_shields_mod/): reduces all player ships' starting shields level to 1, for shieldless runs
* [No free reactor upgrades](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=36284): removes all free reactor rewards, for a "no reactor upgrades" challenge
* [No reactor](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=36283&p=125008): removes all reactor power from player ships, for reactorless runs. Yes, this is as insane as it sounds

## Balance mods

These **do change gameplay**. I’m not currently using them, but I do like them.

* [Twinge’s balance mod](http://www.it-is-law.com/ftl-balance/index.php?title=Main_Page): a large number of subtle balance changes intended to improve the experience
* [Balance mod light](https://mikehopley.github.io/Balance-Mod-Light/): my modified version of the above, reverting many changes for a closer-to-vanilla feeling
