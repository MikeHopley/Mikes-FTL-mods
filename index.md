# Mike's FTL mods

**Work in progress, some links missing.**

These are the mods I use with FTL. I made some of them, but not others.

You will need [Slipstream Mod Manager](http://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=17102) to install mods.

## Quality of life

These mods remove some tedium from the game. They confer an *extremely* small advantage, which I consider irrelevant.

* [Fleet pursuit indicator](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=26289)
* [Cheatengine](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/621w0b/training_speedhack_instructions_external_software/)

Cheatengine is not actually a mod, it’s an external program. I use the speedhack as a “fast forward” button.

## Graphics and music

These mods make the game look and sound better.

* [Pretty shields](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=32736)
* [Mike’s graphical fixes](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=35599)
* Mike’s background mod **link needed**
* [Mike’s music mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/agl0gx/music_mod/)
* [Smaller tooltips](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=35680&p=124808#p124808)
* [Nope mod](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lhw8fu4xry1nc8b/NOPE.ftl)

The shields mod is my original work, but the background mod is mostly compiled from other people’s work: I made rings for two planets, and added some other nice backgrounds I found on Google. None of the backgrounds are excessively bright or “splashy”.

My music mod does not include the tracks, you’ll need to buy them. Step-by-step instructions are provided, including how you can customise it for your own music.

The tooltips mod reduces those giant text boxes, by putting less text in them.


## Balance mods

I’m not currently using these.

* [Twinge’s Balance Mod](http://www.it-is-law.com/ftl-balance/index.php?title=Main_Page)
* [Balance Mod Light](https://mikehopley.github.io/Balance-Mod-Light/)

I used to play with Twinge’s Balance Mod. It sticks very close to vanilla gameplay and difficulty, while trying to improve the balance and decision making.

Balance Mod Light is my modified version of Twinge’s Balance Mod. It mostly just reverts some changes.

## Challenge mods

I made these mods for doing challenge runs.

* [Broken Shields](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/bq26to/broken_shields_mod/)
* No free reactor upgrades **link needed**
* No reactor **link needed**

“Broken shields” is intended for shieldless runs. It reduces all ships’ shield systems to level 1, just like Zoltan B.

“No free reactor upgrades” removes all free reactor from events. You can still get the same event outcome, it just won’t give you the reactor power. This is handy for  “No upgrade” runs, if you feel purist about the challenge.

“No reactor” is intended for purely Zoltan-powered runs. It removes all ships’ reactor power, and removes backup battery from the game. It also includes the “No free reactor upgrades” mod. This is probably the hardest challenge in FTL. So far I’ve only completed it with Zoltan C.
