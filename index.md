# Mike's FTL mods

These are the mods I use with FTL. I made some of them, but not others.

You will need [Slipstream Mod Manager](http://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=17102) to install mods.

## Bundled together

* [Mike’s standard mods](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=36292) (version 1.4)

This combines all the mods I use in regular runs. I provide versions without Fleet Pursuit, and without the music.

Aside from the optional Fleet Pursuit Indicator, this mod makes no gameplay changes.

## Quality of life

These reduce tedium. My standard mods bundle includes these two, though there is also a version without Fleet Pursuit:

* [Enhanced fleet pursuit](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=38228)
* [Better crew defaults](http://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=36285&p=125013)

Cheatengine is not a mod, it's an external program. It can be used to speed up the game or assign skills instantly:

* [Cheatengine](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/621w0b/training_speedhack_instructions_external_software/)
* [Cheatengine table for FTL crew skills](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/qbzev0/convenient_crew_training_cheat_engine_table/)


## Graphics and music

These mods make the game look and sound better. They are included in my standard mods bundle.

* [Pretty shields](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=32736) (version 1.2)
* [Mike’s graphical fixes](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=35599) (version 1.4)

* [Nope mod](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lhw8fu4xry1nc8b/NOPE.ftl) (just replaces “Resist” with “Nope”)
* [Beam colour changes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x0apzk1874gyyy4/Beam%20colour%20tweaks%20v1.0.ftl?dl=0)
* [Swarm missile sound](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=36287)
* [Hide banner ad](http://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=32910)

## Challenge mods

I made these mods for doing challenge runs. They are **not** included in my standard mods bundle.

* [Broken shields](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/bq26to/broken_shields_mod/)
* [No free reactor upgrades](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=36284)
* [No reactor](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=36283&p=125008) (includes the previous mod)

## Balance mods

I’m not currently using these, but I do like them. They are **not** included in my standard mods bundle.

* [Twinge’s balance mod](http://www.it-is-law.com/ftl-balance/index.php?title=Main_Page)
* [Balance mod light](https://mikehopley.github.io/Balance-Mod-Light/)
